# Sales-segmentation-using-RFM-analysis-
## Introduction
Have you ever wondered which customers drive the most value for a business — and which ones are slowly slipping away?

In this project, I walk through the complete process of building a customer segmentation dashboard using RFM analysis — starting from raw transactional data and ending with a fully interactive Power BI dashboard.

By the end of this project, you’ll understand:

How RFM analysis works
How to calculate RFM metrics from sales data
How to segment customers into meaningful business groups
How to design a dashboard that supports data-driven decision making

## What is RFM Analysis?

RFM stands for:

Recency – How recently a customer made a purchase
(More recent = more engaged)

Frequency – How often a customer makes purchases
(More purchases = more loyal)

Monetary – How much money a customer spends
(Higher spend = higher value)

## 🔄 Data Transformation

Since the raw dataset is at the transaction level, it needs to be aggregated to the customer level. For each customer, the following metrics are calculated:

📅 Most recent purchase date
🔢 Total number of orders placed
💰 Total sales value contributed

This summarized customer-level dataset forms the foundation for:

RFM scoring
Customer segmentation
Dashboard creation

This transformation is what converts raw sales data into clear, actionable customer insights.
